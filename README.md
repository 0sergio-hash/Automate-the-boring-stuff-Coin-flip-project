# Automate-the-boring-stuff-Coin-flip-project
My practice coin flip project from Automate the boring stuff chapter 4
The instructions for this project can be found at https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter4/
A couple changes I made were adding heads and tails streak variables, as well as diving by 10000 instead of 100 
My thinking was that if we were looking for streaks in 10,000 randomly generated lists of 100, we should be diving total streaks per "experiment" 
by the total # of experiments, rather than by 100, but I could be wrong.
All the resources I found online used loops  and variables to iterate over the experiment list to count streaks; I used the str() and count()
functions to do the same. I did some testing, and believe they are doing the job fine, though I could be wrong.

Would love any feedback on the project !
